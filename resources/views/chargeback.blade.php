            <p>Korba will liaise with its service providers and endeavour to effect refund of a wrong transfer as soon as possible, but in any event not later than 20 days from the date on which a request was made.</p>

            <p>We do not have any obligation to cancel any transfer instructions and refund to the subscriber in the event of any dispute with any designated payee.</p>

            <p>All terms and conditions in relation to refunds for the various service providers (mobile money institutions) will apply.</p>

        <p>When complaints are received, they would be thoroughly investigated, and if a refund is due, our refund policy shall apply. Kindly refer to the refund policy for more information.</p>

        <p>However, if a complaint is a chargeback, you would be directed to your bank to have the issue addressed. Most banks have a chargeback policy which would apply.</p>
